### Styling
Locker was created with the intent of directing all attention to content by removing as many distractions as possible.

In this context, minimal styling was used with a bare black-and-white color palette. However, because absolute black text on a white background is straining to the eyes, #222222 was used in place of #000000 to help alleviate this problem.

Lastly, large icons and input fields were used to make the transition to mobile optimization easier.
